//Problem Statement
//When we are given a set of rectangles like one in the graph paper we have to go from one grid of rectangle at the corner of the rectangle to the other corner considering that you can only go down or right and you would always go one rectangle in each step. Now find the number of ways in which we can go there.
//The input would  be n and m where the rectangle would be of n X m.
